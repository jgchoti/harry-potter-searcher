# Project Name: PotterAPI Search Application

## Introduction

The PotterAPI Search Application is a project designed to interact with the PotterAPI to perform searches and retrieve information 
from the Harry Potter database. This application was developed as part of my studies with HackYourFuture Belgium, 
aimed at deepening my understanding of JavaScript.

## Project Goals

The primary goal of this project is to implement the following features for interacting with the PotterAPI:

- **Searching Entities:** Users can search for various entities within the Harry Potter universe, such as characters, spells, potions, books and movies.

- **Viewing Details:** Users can view detailed information about specific entities retrieved from the PotterAPI, including attributes, descriptions, and associated data.

- **Filtering Results:** Users can apply filters to narrow down search results based on specific criteria (e.g., house, famaily, type of spell, etc.).

- **API Integration:**  Integrate with the PotterAPI to fetch real-time data and handle API responses.

- **Error Handling:** Provide  error messages to users in case of invalid searches or API errors.

- **Pagination:** Implement pagination for search results.

## What I Have Learned During This Project

### JavaScript Fundamentals
- **Event Handling:** handling various events such as clicks, form submissions, and API responses.
- **DOM Manipulation:** manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) to dynamically update the web page based on user interactions and API data.

### API Integration
- **Fetching Data:** use `fetch` and `async/await` to retrieve data from the PotterAPI.
- **Error Handling:**  manage API errors and provide feedback to users.

### Separation of Concerns
- **Code Organization:** separating UI components, logic, and data handling.

### Pagination Implementation
- **User Experience:** pagination to handle large datasets.

## Future Development Goals

Looking forward, my aim is to expand the functionality of this project. This includes implementing features such as:
- **Responsive Design:** Ensure the application is accessible and usable on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
